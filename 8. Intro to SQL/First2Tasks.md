1.**What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.**

* Structured Query Language is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

* The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is the subset of SQL used to add, update and delete data.
Data manipulation languages have their functional capability organized by the initial word in a statement, which is almost always a verb. In the case of SQL, these verbs are:
 * SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
 * INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...
 * UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...
 * DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...

* The Data Definition Language (DDL) manages table and index structure. The most basic items of DDL are the CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP and TRUNCATE statemens.

2 . **What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?**

* Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases.
